#Yet Another Awesome!

A sort-of curated index of swell techy stuff using the Yet Another prefix. Inspired by awesome-*_ awesome^awesome, awesome-etc, and the like.

### What's up with this?

How many libraries, scripts, (web)apps, compilers, stylesheets, modules, or what-have-you, have you seen that begin with the words Yet Another? It's an interesting convention, defaulting to Yet Another (whether a title has eluded the developer or it just seemed appropriate).

So... why not a list? Most of these are just pulled straight from my bookmarks, to start with.

### Contributing

Uh, y'know. Contribute things, and stuff. I look to [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) for inspiration for guidelines on this stuff, but rules are whatever. You do you.
