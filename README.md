### What's up with this?

[The Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/Yet-Another.html) says
>Yet Another: adj.
>
>    [From Unix's yacc(1), ‘Yet Another Compiler-Compiler’, a LALR parser generator]
>
>    1. Of your own work: A humorous allusion often used in titles to acknowledge
>    that the topic is not original, though the content is. As in ‘Yet Another AI Group’
>    or ‘Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm’.


How many libraries, scripts, (web)apps, compilers, stylesheets, modules, or
what-have-you, have you seen that begin with the words Yet Another? It's an
interesting convention, and it pops up seemingly everywhere.

So... why not a list?
